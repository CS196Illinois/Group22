## Sprint 0
#### Get to know each other 
#### Set up Github Repo
#### Set up meeting time
#### Finish our MVP
#### Decide on additional features we would like to implement given we have additional time

## Sprint 1
#### Learn tech stack: ReactJs, Flask, SkLearn, TensorFlow, etc.
#### Learn machine learnig concepts and basics. Please watch this cool lecture by Eustis: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqRKxYFkYIc
#### Research on what machine learning model we want to use.
#### Gather dataset to feed into ML model.
#### Set up environment.

## Sprint 2
#### Data exploration on Jupyter Notebook.
#### Continue learning/research if have not yet fully completed on sprint 1.
#### Evaluate ML Models using different techniques such as precision, recall, accuracy, f1_score, MCC score
#### Start playing around with react and flask

## Sprint 3
#### Build website
#### Split into two teams backend and frontend
#### First half of web development
#### More info to come

## Sprint 4
